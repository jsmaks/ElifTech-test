In this project, I've implemented several key features to enhance functionality and improve user experience.

Features Added
Base Functionality: Introduced the foundational features that form the core of the application.
Sorting and Searching: Integrated sorting and searching capabilities from the Middle layer to allow users to efficiently navigate through data.
Pagination: Implemented pagination from the Advanced layer to optimize data presentation and improve load times.
Event Creation: Added functionality for users to create and add new events to the application.
